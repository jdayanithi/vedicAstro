## 🚀 Ready for Production Deployment

### **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Set Environment Variables** (Required before startup):
   ```bash
   # Windows
   ./setup-env-windows.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac  
   ./setup-env-linux.sh
   ```

2. **Production Deployment**:
   ```bash
   java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
   ```

3. **Security Validation**:
   - Test file uploads with various file types
   - Verify error responses contain no sensitive information
   - Confirm rate limiting activates under load
   - Check security headers in browser developer tools

### **Security Monitoring Setup:**
- Monitor logs for security violation patterns
- Set up alerts for repeated failed upload attempts
- Track error rates and authentication failures
- Review access patterns regularly

## 🏆 Security Achievements

- **OWASP Top 10 Compliance** ✅
