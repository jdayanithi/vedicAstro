# AOP Performance Monitoring Implementation

## Overview
This implementation uses Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to intercept all controller requests and monitor their performance. It automatically logs requests that take longer than a configurable threshold (default: 1 second).

## Features

### üîç **Automatic Request Interception**
- Intercepts all methods in `com.vedicastrology.controller.*` packages
- Measures execution time for each request
- Handles exceptions and logs them with timing information

### ‚ö° **Performance Monitoring**
- **Slow Request Detection**: Logs requests taking longer than threshold with WARNING level
- **All Request Logging**: Optional logging of all requests (configurable)
- **Debug Logging**: All requests logged at DEBUG level for development

### üìä **Detailed Logging Information**
- **Method Name**: Which controller method was called
- **Execution Time**: How long the request took in milliseconds
- **HTTP Method & URI**: GET/POST /api/endpoint
- **Client IP Address**: Real client IP (handles proxy headers)
- **User Agent**: Browser/client information (truncated for readability)

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Options**
All settings can be configured in `application.properties`:

```properties
# Enable/disable performance monitoring
performance.logging.enabled=true

# Threshold for slow request detection (milliseconds)
performance.logging.threshold-ms=1000

# Log all requests at INFO level (not just slow ones)
performance.logging.log-all-requests=false

# Include detailed request information in logs
performance.logging.include-request-details=true

# Include User-Agent header in logs
performance.logging.include-user-agent=true

# Maximum length of User-Agent string in logs
performance.logging.max-user-agent-length=50
```

## Log Examples

### Normal Request (Debug Level):
```
17:25:15.123 [http-nio-8080-exec-1] DEBUG c.v.aop.PerformanceLoggingAspect - ‚ö° Request completed: CourseController.getAllCourses(..) took 245ms | Request: POST /api/secure/courses/get-all | IP: 127.0.0.1 | UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...
```

### Slow Request (Warning Level):
```
17:25:20.456 [http-nio-8080-exec-2] WARN  c.v.aop.PerformanceLoggingAspect - üêå SLOW REQUEST DETECTED: LessonController.getAllLessonsByTopic(..) took 1847ms | Request: POST /api/secure/lessons/get-by-topic | IP: 192.168.1.100 | UserAgent: Chrome/120.0.0.0...
```

### Failed Request (Error Level):
```
17:25:25.789 [http-nio-8080-exec-3] ERROR c.v.aop.PerformanceLoggingAspect - üí• REQUEST FAILED: UserController.getUserById(..) took 156ms and threw exception | Request: POST /api/secure/users/get-by-id | IP: 127.0.0.1 | Error: User not found with ID: 999
```

## Benefits

### üöÄ **Performance Optimization**
- Identify slow endpoints that need optimization
- Monitor performance improvements after code changes
- Detect performance regressions quickly

### üêõ **Debugging & Monitoring**
- Trace request execution times across the application
- Identify bottlenecks in the system
- Monitor API usage patterns

### üìà **Production Monitoring**
- Real-time performance monitoring in production
- Configurable logging levels to avoid log spam
- Detailed request context for troubleshooting

## Usage in Development

### For Performance Testing:
1. Set `performance.logging.log-all-requests=true` to see all request times
2. Use `performance.logging.threshold-ms=500` for stricter monitoring
3. Monitor logs while testing to identify slow operations

### For Production:
1. Keep `performance.logging.log-all-requests=false` 
2. Set appropriate threshold (1000ms is reasonable for most APIs)
3. Monitor WARNING logs for slow requests that need attention

## Advanced Features

### üåê **IP Address Detection**
The aspect detects real client IP addresses even behind proxies by checking headers in order:
- X-Forwarded-For
- X-Real-IP
- Proxy-Client-IP
- WL-Proxy-Client-IP
- And other common proxy headers

### üîß **Runtime Configuration**
All settings can be changed in `application.properties` without code changes and can be externalized for different environments.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Exception Handling**
The aspect doesn't interfere with normal exception handling - it logs the exception details and re-throws the original exception.

This implementation provides comprehensive performance monitoring with minimal overhead and maximum configurability.
